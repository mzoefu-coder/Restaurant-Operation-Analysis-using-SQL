# Restaurant-Operation-Analysis-using-SQL
The World Cafe debuted a new menu at the start of the year. You’ve been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well/not well and what top customers seem to like best.
The objectives for this project are as follows:
Explore the menu items table to get an idea of what’s in the menu.
Explore the order details table to get an idea of the data being collected.
Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.
