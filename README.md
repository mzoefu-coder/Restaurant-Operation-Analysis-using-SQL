# Restaurant-Operation-Analysis-using-SQL
The World Cafe debuted a new menu at the start of the year. You’ve been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well/not well and what top customers seem to like best.
The objectives for this project are as follows

Explore the menu items table to get an idea of what’s in the menu.

Explore the order details table to get an idea of the data being collected.

Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.


##Overall Key Insights  
•	Italian cuisine is the most premium and popular category.  
•	Asian dishes are highly represented in top orders, which suggests customers prefer variety.  
•	High-spend orders often feature 10 to 14 items, which suggests group dining or shared orders.  
•	Menu pricing is strategically tiered; affordable (American/Mexican), midrange (Asian), and premium (Italian).  
•	The short analysis window (Jan to Mar 2023) provides clear short-term trends suitable for menu optimization.  

##Summary  
The SQL analysis provides valuable insights into World Café’s operations, highlighting the dominance of Italian cuisine in both pricing and popularity. It also shows the strong performance of Asian dishes in large orders and consistent spending patterns among top customers. These insights can guide management decisions in pricing, promotions, and menu design to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction

##Recommendations  
• Maintain or slightly increase prices for Italian dishes due to strong demand and perceived premium value.  
• Consider promotional discounts for lower-performing Asian appetizers like Potstickers to boost sales.  
• Promote combo meals or bundles featuring Italian and Asian dishes together to encourage mixed-category spending.  
• Retain mid-priced items that balance profitability and popularity.
• Target marketing toward family or group diners, given frequent high-item orders.  
• Offer loyalty rewards or discounts for orders exceeding a certain spend threshold (e.g., over $180).  
• Extend data collection beyond March 2023 to identify seasonal or monthly sales trends.  
• Incorporate customer demographics (if available) for behavior-based segmentation.
